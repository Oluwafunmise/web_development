        <h1>Web Devlopment Project Overview</h1>
        <h2>Using HTML and CSS, the project's goal was to create a website that would be both mobile-friendly and
            functional. The website's goal was to present a portfolio of different projects.</h2>

        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <h2>The principal tactic involved utilising responsive design principles. To adapt the layout, font sizes, and
            spacing according to the screen size, CSS media queries were used. Through the definition of breakpoints
            where the layout shifts, the website could fluidly adjust to varying screen sizes.</h2>

        <h2>Viewport Meta Tag: It was imperative that the viewport meta tag be used in the HTML head section. By
            ensuring that the page is rendered by the browser at the proper width for the device, this tag helps to
            avoid problems like having to zoom out to view the complete page on the screen.</h2>

        <h2>Optimized Images: Optimizing images for the web, including resizing and     them, helped improve page loading
            times on mobile devices. Additionally, utilizing the max width: 100%; (95% in my own case) CSS property
            ensured that images scaled appropriately to fit smaller screens without losing clarity.
        </h2>

        <h1>Challenges and Solution </h1>

        <h2>Navigation: It was difficult to make the menus more manageable on smaller screens. Utilising strategies like
            foldable hamburger menus allowed for space conservation without sacrificing usefulness.

            Touch Targets: It was crucial to make sure that clickable components, like buttons and links, were
            proportionally sized for touch input on mobile devices. The user experience was enhanced by making these
            items larger.

            In summary, adopting responsive design concepts, content optimisation, and guaranteeing a consistent user
            experience across devices are all part of developing a website mobile-friendly with HTML and CSS. By
            implementing these tactics, the website would interact and reach visitors on mobile devices more efficiently,
            improving accessibility and usability.</h2>

        <h1>CYS 1063 Module Review</h1>
        <h2>I had a great experience with the Web Development Module and I am still having, it’s been quite a fascinating one as we’ve got a quite understandable and listening tutor. It was quite draining because I was procrastinating a lot and I had to do all in a rushed period (I didn’t sleep for two days straight). I loved the fact that we had recording for each week of lecture which really helped at the end! I also organised group meetings with my peers just to discuss things that seemed unclear and difficult. In all, it was and it is a quite enjoyable Module.</h2>
